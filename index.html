            The story is about three brothers who, travelling together, reach a
            treacherous river. They make a magical bridge over the river.
            Halfway across the bridge, they meet the personification of Death
            who is angry for losing three potential victims. He pretends to be
            impressed by them and grants each a wish as a reward. The eldest
            brother asks for an unbeatable dueling wand, so Death gives him the
            Elder Wand. The middle brother asks for the ability to resurrect the
            dead, so Death gives him the Resurrection Stone. The youngest
            brother doesn't trust Death and asks for a way to stop Death from
            following him, so Death reluctantly gives him his Cloak of
            Invisibility. Afterwards, the brothers go their separate ways.
          </p>
          <p>
            The eldest brother, bragging about his powerful wand, is robbed of
            it and murdered while he is asleep. The middle brother uses his
            ability to bring back the woman he loved, who died before he could
            marry her. However, she is not fully alive and is full of sorrow. He
            kills himself to join her. As for the youngest brother, Death never
            manages to find him, as he stays hidden under his Cloak. Many years
            later, the brother removes his cloak and gives it to his son.
            Pleased with his achievements, he greets Death as an old friend and
            chooses to leave with him as equals.
